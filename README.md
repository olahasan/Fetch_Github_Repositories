This project allows users to enter a GitHub username and fetch the repositories associated with that username. The application displays the repository names, visit links, and star counts. It includes a loading indicator and handles errors gracefully, providing a user-friendly experience.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter a GitHub username in the input field.
3. Click the "Get Repos" button to fetch and display the repositories.

### Links

If you want to open the link in a new tab, you can:

- Press **Ctrl** (or **Cmd** on Mac) while clicking the link.
- Right-click the link and select **Open link in new tab**.

Otherwise, all links will open in the same tab.
